<!-- ## R Markdown -->

<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->

### Comparison of SAPT2+3 components between basis sets

```{r, include=FALSE}
s88_long_allsapt <- gather(s88_allsapt.dt, EnComp, En, Electrostatics:Total.SAPT2.3) %>% 
    spread(basis, En) %>% 
    data.table()

s88_long_allsapt[, basisDiff := VDZ - aVDZ]
```

Here is the comparison between cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVDZ for SAPT2+3 components:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
s88_long_allsapt[, as.list(nomed.stats(basisDiff)), by = .(EnComp)]
```

As you can see, there are some large deviations for Dispersion and Electrostatics. For the minor terms, Disp20, Elst10.r, Exch.Ind30.r, Exch10, Exch10.S.2., and Ind30.r are also large.
